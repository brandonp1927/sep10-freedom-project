    <h5 class="card-title">Drills</h5>
    <p class="card-text">Drills are handheld devices, the first electric drill was first invented in 1889 by Arthur James Arnot and William Blanch Brain at Melbourne Australia who had the i4dea to combine it to the electric motor. Then someone had the idea to design the drill to fit in the user's hand and make it portable and those were Wilhelm and Carl Fein in Germany. 
The drill is a tool that uses rotation to make a hole into metal, wood, to also tighten screws, loosen screws. There are 16 different types of drills that are similar but have many different purposes. But here are the main 3 which are traditional drills that are used for basic house projects, drilling holes, and drilling needles into wood. Impact Driver is for more heavy work, they drill fasteners into place, drilling in long screws with rapid pounding movements. Hammer drills drill quickly into concrete, and are used for demolition.

<h1>Context</h1>
<p><b>This device that I made using A-frame is a intelligent AI that will help construction workers in the future. A hand held device that scans the certain place that you want to work on, it will show the clear instructions on how to work on your project indicating what tools u will need. This device will gurantee any buildings, skyscrapers, houses are well built. This will also reduce the amount of time measuring when the AI has everything ready for the user, and reduce the amount of time spent on a big construction project, and reduce the amount of accidental deaths, and accidents caused by unsecure equipment.</b> </p>
